        <h2>Strongest Traits and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My strongest traits are emotional stability and conscientiousness, which significantly impact my academic life. Emotional stability allows me to remain calm and focused during stressful situations, such as exams, helping me manage anxiety effectively. Conscientiousness drives my organization and diligence, enabling me to stay on top of my studies and complete assignments on time. My love for problem-solving, particularly in mathematics, has led to outstanding performance in all math-related modules I've taken. By effectively regulating my emotions and behavior, I can avoid distractions and unwanted attention, further enhancing my academic success.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="hero">
        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p><strong>My Hero:</strong> Daniel from the Bible</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong> One of my favorite scenes involving Daniel is when he interprets King Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Despite the king's harsh decree to execute all wise men if no one could interpret the dream, Daniel prayed to God and received the interpretation. He then explained the dream to the king, revealing God's message and saving many lives (Daniel 2:1-49).</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Motto:</strong> "God is my judge." This reflects Daniel's unwavering faith and integrity, as he always sought to honor God in his actions, regardless of the consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Daniel is My Hero:</strong> Daniel is my hero because of his remarkable ability to interpret dreams, which demonstrates his deep connection with God and his wisdom. His story inspires me to seek understanding and guidance through faith, especially in challenging situations. Daniel's courage, integrity, and unwavering faith are qualities I strive to embody in my own life.</p>

        <h2>Personality Test</h2>
        <p>I used an online personality tool to assess myself. Below are the results of the test.</p>
        <img src="../assetshtml/first.png" alt="Personality Test Result 1">
        <img src="../assetshtml/second.png" alt="Personality Test Result 2">
        <p>The personality test revealed insights about my traits and behaviors. In general, I believe the test has validity as it accurately reflected my characteristics and tendencies. The results provided me with valuable self-awareness and reinforced my understanding of my strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
